# Data Coding Problems

This repository is a collection of the data coding problems from the mailing
list of the [same name](https://dailycodingproblem.com/). Slowly I will try and
provide my answers for each of them - mostly as a self improvement exercise.

**Note:** the Daily Coding people currently charge $8 a month for the answers -
which I don't subscribe to - therefore, the any answers (and mistakes) in this
repository are mine only and may or may not even be correct.
